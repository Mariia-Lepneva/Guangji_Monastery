# Social network data for Guangji Monastery in Beijing in the seventeenth century
# 清初北京廣濟寺社會網絡

This repository provides social network data for Beijing Guangji Monastery in the seventeenth century, based on the [monastery gazetteer](http://buddhistinformatics.dila.edu.tw/fosizhi/ui.html?book=g044). This data underlies Figures 1 and 2 in my paper:

`Lepneva, Mariia. "Institutional Adaptation of Chinese Buddhism to the Ming-Qing Transition: Two-Lineage Model of Guangji Monastery in Beijing." *Journal of Chinese Buddhist Studies* (forthcoming)`

Figure 1 features the peculiar institutional arrangement that took shape in Guangji Monastery in the second half of the seventeenth century. Control over the monastery was shared by a tonsure lineage and an ordination lineage. 

Figure 2 presents the networks of the monks of Guangji Monastery. Not only were they connected to each other, but they also developed ties with the Qing emperors and capital officials.

The repository includes Gephi files, image files, and Excel files for both Figures.
